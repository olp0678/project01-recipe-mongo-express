\\ Find information on MongoDB cursors

https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/iterate-a-cursor/
The db.collection.find() method returns a cursor. To access the
documents, you need to iterate the cursor. However, in the mongo
shell, if the returned cursor is not assigned to a variable using
 the var keyword, then the cursor is automatically iterated up to
 20 times [1] to print up to the first 20 documents in the results.


https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.forEach/
cursor.forEach(function)

Iterates the cursor to apply a JavaScript function to each document from the cursor.

The forEach() method has the following prototype form:

db.collection.find().forEach(<function>)
